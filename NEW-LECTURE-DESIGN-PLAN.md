# New Lecture Page Design Plan

## Current Issues
- Large purple gradient header takes too much space
- Category buttons are too prominent and colorful
- Overall design feels cluttered
- Not professional enough

## New Design Concept

### Clean, Minimal, Professional Layout

**Top Section (Compact):**
- Small, clean title "Physics Lectures" (left aligned, simple text)
- Search bar (right aligned, minimal design)
- Subtle category filter dropdown or tabs (minimal, not buttons)

**Main Content:**
- Clean white background
- Lecture cards in a responsive grid
- Each card:
  - Clean thumbnail
  - Title
  - Duration, instructor
  - Subtle hover effect
  - Play icon overlay

**Color Scheme:**
- Mostly white/light gray background
- Minimal use of color (only for accents)
- Professional typography
- Subtle shadows

**Layout:**
- Maximum width container (1200px)
- Generous white space
- Clean grid system
- Mobile responsive

## Implementation
I'll replace the entire content section with this new clean design.
